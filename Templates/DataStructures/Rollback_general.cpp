// GENERAL IDEA OF ROLLBACK - maintain a stack or vector storing memory cells that are changed and their original value
// while doing rollback, take last element of stack and gives original values to parameters and delete from stack

// If adding elements is O(T(n)) in true(not amortized), then deletion will be in O(T(n)logn) offline.
